You’re dependable! When others ask you to do something or show up somewhere, they know they can rely on you to follow through. You care about doing things the right way and rarely need a reminder.    
You value preparation, planning, and precision and like to surround yourself with others who feel the same way. 
You appreciate when others are considerate of your schedule. A heads up when someone is going to be late or an apology when plans change goes a long way!
You also want to make sure your relationships are in order. You show gratitude and appreciation for the people you care about by planning or doing something for them.

According to motivation science, Order is the passion most related to structure and stability. If you score high in this passion, you might crave structure so much that you experience stress when things don't go according to plan. 
Unmanaged Order can lead to obsession with your schedule—your desire to have things run smoothly can distract you from managing your time in other areas. And when you focus more and more on how you think it should be, it only makes you more stressed! 
Your need for structure can make others feel like you're controlling them or being nitpicky. It can cause them to be afraid to make mistakes, and they might feel like you don't trust them to do things right. 
Additionally, when others suggest a new way of approaching a task, you can struggle to adapt and change course. You might want to stick to your plan even when things become difficult! This inflexibility can prevent you from experiencing something great—and that's the last thing you want!",210,"[ 0.00334595 -0.00385059  0.01729435 ...  0.00320772  0.0008444

According to motivation science, Status is the passion most related to respect based on social standing. If you score high in this passion, it can make you reluctant to work with people who don’t appear to be important. Status can cloud your judgment and cause you to overlook opportunities with others—you might miss out on something great! 
Unmanaged Status can also lead to a sense of entitlement. If you work hard, you want to receive credit for everything you do. You want everyone to notice! If you believe you are entitled to more respect than others give you, you might complain about unfair treatment. It can lead you to feel anger and resentment. 
As you try to show the best of yourself, your Status passion might communicate, ""I am more important than you"" to others. This mindset can make you mistreat people who, to you, are ""regular."" Ultimately, unmanaged Status might lead you to underestimate the abilities of others and limit what you can learn from them.",209,"[-0.00285832 -0.02698874  0.03402461 ... -0.00306477  0.00408859

You can be less inclined to travel, especially far away from home. Being surrounded by familiar people and things helps you feel safe!

According to motivation science, Tranquility is the passion most related to avoiding anxiety and pain. If you score high in this passion, you have one goal: inner peace. But you might desire it so much that trying to get it makes you stressed—and that's the opposite of what you want! 
Having unmanaged Tranquility can make you constantly worry about the worst-case scenario. It might lead you to feel like change is a threat to the peace you want so much. Even the tiniest change can put you on edge and cause you to lose focus! 
Tranquility can bring peace to yourself and others, but if it's unmanaged, it can make you increasingly nervous, affect your eating and sleeping habits, and cause you to forget important things.

According to motivation science, Vengeance is the passion most related to confrontation. Although Vengeance can help you view all the facts, data reveals that unmanaged Vengeance can skew your perception and make you want to compete and fight the people around you. 
If your Vengeance is unmanaged, it can lead to unhealthy comparisons. It can make you prideful of your abilities and envious of others. You can get jealous when people around you are recognized, get ahead of you, or appear more gifted. When it seems like people are threatening you or the people you care about, you can become angry—even to the point of physical confrontation. Your actions or words can hurt people and burn bridges.
